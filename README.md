# Titanic_EDA_Project
This is Exploratory Data Analysis Project of Titanic Dataset. There are 2 CSV files. I used Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis.

# EDA use:
- Model building
- analysis and reporting
- validate assumptions
- handling missing values
- feature engineering
- detecting outliers

# Steps of EDA
1. Finding column type (Numeric, Category, Mixed)
-Featuring Eng. (if required)
2. Univariate Analysis (all columns)
    - Distribution analysis: shape, central tendency, outliers
        (Missing values, outliears, skeewness)
    - Visualizations
    - conclusion
-Featuring Eng. (if required)
3. Bivariate analysis (with Target Column)
-Featuring Eng. (if required)
    - Num-Num: linechart
    - Cat-Cat: crosstab
    - Cat-Num: barplot
4. Multivariate Analysis
    - Corelation
5. Conclusion

# Conclusion of Project:
1. Passengers who are traveling in 1st class have more chance to survive and if they are females then it is plus point
2. Passengers whose age is near by 39 choose 1st Pclass.
3. Passengers whose age in range of 20 to 40 have more chance to survive
4. Marjority of Passengers are Youngsters (age range 20 to 40)
5. With choosing C Embarked passengers, it gives additional chance to survive
6. Those passengers are alone who have only 30% chance to survive
7. Group of 4 or less than 4 have more than 50% chance to survive otherwise 80% chance to unsurvive
